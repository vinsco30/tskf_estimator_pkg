# tskf_estimator_pkg
Estimator based on Two Stage Kalman Filter [1]

### Done
- Estimator function
- Coversion of input from the Gazebo from NED to ENU)
- Everything done only on hummingbird model
- Tests with the estimator (it works but very slowly)

### To Do
- Improvement of the estimation (check the function and conversion from the models and the paper)
- Implementation for the other gazebo models

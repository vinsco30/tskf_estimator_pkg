# tskf_estimator_pkg
Estimator based on Two Stage Kalman Filter [1]

### Done
- Estimator function
- Coversion of input from the Gazebo from NED to ENU)
- Everything done only on hummingbird model

### To Do
- Conversion of the motor velocities or modify the entry model of the linearized system
- Complete tests
